How it Works
Item Controller
The ItemCtrl module manages the food items, including adding, updating, deleting, and tracking the total calorie intake. It uses a local data structure (data) to hold the items.

UI Controller
The UICtrl module manages the user interface (UI) updates. It displays food items in a list, handles user input, and updates the displayed total calorie count.

App Controller
The App module integrates the ItemCtrl and UICtrl modules. It initializes the app, loads event listeners, and handles form submissions, item edits, and item deletions.

Usage Instructions
Add an Item: Enter the name of the food and its calorie value, then click the "Add Item" button.

Edit an Item: Click the pencil icon next to an item, update its name or calorie value, and click the "Update" button.

Delete an Item: Click the trash icon next to an item to remove it.

Clear All Items: Click the "Clear All Items" button to remove all food items.

Total Calories: The total calorie count will update automatically based on the items in the list.
